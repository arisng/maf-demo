# Microsoft Agent Framework Demos - Roadmap & Progress Tracker

This document tracks the progressive complexity demonstrations for the Microsoft Agent Framework, serving as both a planning guide and progress index.

## Overview

Each demo builds incrementally on previous ones, adding new concepts and complexity while maintaining working implementations.

## ✅ Demo 1: Simple Sequential Workflow

**Status**: COMPLETED

**Complexity Level**: Basic

**Concepts Demonstrated**:
- Sequential executor chaining
- Basic `Executor<TInput, TOutput>` pattern
- Simple message passing with `AddEdge()`
- Single-path workflow execution
- Basic console output

**Implementation**:
- InputAgent → ProcessorAgent → OutputAgent
- Straightforward linear execution
- No branching or parallelism

**Files**:
- `demo1/demo1/Program.cs`
- `demo1/README.md`

---

## ✅ Demo 2: Parallel Execution with Conditional Branching

**Status**: COMPLETED

**Complexity Level**: Intermediate

**Concepts Demonstrated**:
- ✅ **Parallel fan-out** with `AddFanOutEdge()`
- ✅ **Stateful aggregation** pattern (custom collector)
- ✅ **Conditional branching** with `AddSwitch()` and predicate-based routing
- ✅ **Multiple terminal executors** with `WithOutputFrom()`
- ✅ **Proper output handling** (avoiding duplicate yields)
- ✅ **Event streaming** with `WorkflowOutputEvent`
- ✅ **SuperStep-based execution** model

**Implementation**:
- DummyInput → [Writer1, Writer2] (parallel)
- Writers → Aggregator (stateful collection)
- Aggregator → Selector (dual invocations)
- Selector → {Approver | Rejector} (conditional)
- Both terminal executors yield outputs

**Key Learnings**:
- `WithOutputFrom()` auto-yields return values (no manual `YieldOutputAsync()` needed)
- Stateful executors called once per incoming edge
- Dual selector invocations enable both branches to execute
- Framework behavior: Both conditional paths can execute simultaneously

**Files**:
- `demo2/demo2/Program.cs`
- `demo2/README.md` (comprehensive with official docs research)

  - **Concept**: Linear chaining (`A -> B -> C`).
  - **Feature**: `Executor<T>`, `AddEdge`.
- **Demo 2: Parallel & Branching** (✅ Done)
  - **Concept**: Doing things at once & making decisions.
  - **Feature**: `AddFanOutEdge` (Parallelism), `AddSwitch` (Conditional Logic), Stateful Aggregation.
- **Demo 3: Iterative Feedback Loops** (✅ Done)
  - **Concept**: Self-correction and refinement.
  - **Feature**: Cyclic Graphs, Loop Termination, Type Adaptation in cycles.

### Phase 2: Reliability & Persistence (The "Enterprise Basics")
*Goal: Build systems that survive failures and wait for humans.*

- **Demo 4: Human-in-the-Loop & Persistence** (Next)
  - **Concept**: The "Pause Button" and "Save Game" feature.
  - **Features**:
    - **Checkpointing**: Saving workflow state to disk/DB.
    - **Resuming**: Restarting a workflow from where it left off.
    - **Human Approval**: Pausing execution until a human signal is received.
  - **Technical Feasibility**: ✅ **Supported**.
    - APIs: `CheckpointManager`, `RequestPort<T>`, `InProcessExecution.StreamAsync(..., checkpointManager)`.
  - **Why**: Essential for long-running business processes (e.g., Expense Approval).

  - **Concept**: "Graceful Failure".
  - **Features**:
    - **Retries**: Implementing retry logic within Executors.
    - **Fallbacks**: Routing to a backup agent if the primary fails.
  - **Technical Feasibility**: ⚠️ **Custom Implementation**.
    - APIs: No built-in retry policy. Must use **Polly** or custom `try/catch` loops inside `HandleAsync`.
  - **Why**: Production systems must handle API outages and transient errors.

### Phase 3: Intelligence & Capabilities (The "Brain")
*Goal: Injecting real AI and agency.*

- **Demo 6: AI Integration & Tool Calling**
  - **Concept**: "Real Agents" doing real work.

  - **Features**:
    - **Planner Agent**: An agent that generates the workflow steps at runtime.

- Weighted voting mechanisms
- Consensus algorithms across agents
- Partial result handling with timeouts

**Use Case**: Multiple AI agents vote on best slogan → weighted scoring → consensus selection

**Official Framework Support**:
- ✅ **Concurrent Orchestration**: Automatic aggregation of diverse agent outputs ([Concurrent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/user-guide/workflows/orchestrations/concurrent))
- ✅ **Custom Aggregators**: Override default list aggregation with domain-specific logic

- ✅ **Fan-In Edges**: `AddFanInEdge(aggregator, sources: [agent1, agent2, agent3])`

**Key APIs**: `AgentWorkflowBuilder.BuildConcurrent()`, `AddFanInEdge()`, custom aggregator executors

---

### Option 6: Event-Driven Architecture ✅ (⭐ RECOMMENDED)
**Feasibility**: ✅ **STRONG OFFICIAL SUPPORT**

**Concepts**:
- Custom workflow events (e.g., `DatabaseEvent`, `ProgressEvent`)
- Event subscribers for monitoring
- Progress tracking with percentage complete
- Real-time observability patterns

**Use Case**: Emit progress events throughout workflow → subscribers log/monitor → dashboard updates

**Official Framework Support**:
- ✅ **Custom Events**: Inherit from `WorkflowEvent` and emit with `ctx.AddEventAsync()` ([Events](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/user-guide/workflows/core-concepts/events))
- ✅ **Built-in Events**: `WorkflowStartedEvent`, `WorkflowOutputEvent`, `ExecutorInvokeEvent`, `ExecutorCompleteEvent`, `RequestInfoEvent`
- ✅ **Event Streaming**: `await foreach (var evt in run.WatchStreamAsync())`
- ✅ **Observability**: OpenTelemetry integration with custom spans, logs, metrics

**Key APIs**: `WorkflowEvent`, `ctx.AddEventAsync()`, `setup_observability()`, custom event classes

**Why Recommended**:
- Complements AI agent pattern (Option 4)
- Demonstrates production observability
- Shows extensibility of framework
- Practical for monitoring complex workflows

---

### Option 7: Error Handling and Resilience ⚠️
**Feasibility**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL SUPPORT** (No built-in retry/fallback, use workflow graph patterns)

**Concepts**:
- Retry logic for failed executors
- Fallback paths in workflow graph
- Graceful degradation patterns
- Timeout handling for long operations
- Error event propagation

**Use Case**: AI call fails → retry 3 times → fallback to simpler agent → log errors

**Official Framework Support**:
- ✅ **Error Events**: `WorkflowErrorEvent` emitted on failures ([Events](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/user-guide/workflows/core-concepts/events))
- ⚠️ **Retry Logic**: No built-in retry mechanism; implement via custom executor logic and state
- ⚠️ **Fallback Paths**: Use conditional edges to route to fallback executors based on error state
- ❓ **Timeout Handling**: Not documented; would require custom implementation
- ✅ **Error Propagation**: Exceptions bubble up through workflow event stream

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Custom retry executor wrapper tracking attempt count
- Conditional edges routing to fallback based on failure flag
- Manual timeout tracking in executor state

**Note**: Framework focuses on explicit workflow graphs rather than hidden retry logic. Resilience implemented through graph topology.

---

### Option 8: Multi-Output Streaming ✅
**Feasibility**: ✅ **STRONG OFFICIAL SUPPORT**

**Concepts**:
- Multiple `YieldOutputAsync()` calls per executor
- Streaming intermediate results
- Progress reporting from long-running agents
- When to use manual yield vs `WithOutputFrom()`

**Use Case**: AI agent yields draft → yields revision → yields final → all captured as workflow outputs

**Official Framework Support**:
- ✅ **YieldOutputAsync**: `ctx.YieldOutputAsync(output)` can be called multiple times per executor ([API Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.agents.ai.workflows.iworkflowcontext.yieldoutputasync))
- ✅ **WorkflowOutputEvent**: Each yield emits separate output event
- ✅ **Streaming Execution**: `StreamAsync()` captures all yields in real-time
- ✅ **Official Guidance**: Manual yield appropriate for intermediate progress, multi-step results

**Key APIs**: `ctx.YieldOutputAsync()`, `WorkflowOutputEvent`, avoid mixing with `WithOutputFrom()` on same executor

**Best Practices** (from demo2 research):
- Use `WithOutputFrom()` alone for terminal executors with single output
- Use manual `YieldOutputAsync()` for intermediate/multi-output scenarios
- Never combine both (causes duplicate outputs)

---

## 💡 Recommended Demo 3 Implementation

**Demo 3: "AI-Powered Multi-Agent Workflow with Custom Events"**

**Combines**: Option 4 (AI Agents) + Option 6 (Event-Driven)

**Proposed Architecture**:
```
Input → [AI Writer 1, AI Writer 2, AI Writer 3] (parallel with real LLMs)
  ↓
Aggregator (collects AI-generated slogans)
  ↓
AI Evaluator (uses LLM to score slogans)
  ↓
Selector (picks highest scored)
  ↓
{AI Refiner | DirectPublish} (conditional)
  ↓
